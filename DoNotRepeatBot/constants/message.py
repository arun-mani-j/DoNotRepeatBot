        "@DoNotRepeatBot is a bot to share messages at multiple places when needed "

        "Now the bot will ask you for the message to store. Simply send a "
        "textual message. It can be anything of your creativity!\n\n"
        "The bot should say that the snippet has been added.\n\n"
        "Next, type @DoNotRepeatBot, press <code>space</code> and type <i>hello</i>.\n"
        "The bot should suggest you the snippet you added, tap on it and the bot sends "
        "it to the chat! That's it!\n\n"
        "If you don't get the snippet, make sure you are typing the title correctly. "
        "Else, try after a few seconds, as Telegram might <i>cache</i> the results.\n"
