"@DoNotRepeatBot is a bot to share messages at multiple places when needed "

"\n"
"Take it like this. You have a message you happen to use at multiple chats so "
"what you do is, save the message to <i>Saved Messages</i> and forward it "
"everytime you need it.\n"
"@DoNotRepeatBot does the same, but with extra features and more "
"streamlined!\n"
"\n"
"<b>Getting Started</b>\n"
"Let's start with a simple example. Start the bot in private message. Type "
"and send <code>/add hello</code>.\n"
"Now the bot will ask you for the message to store. Simply send a textual "
"message. It can be anything of your creativity!\n"
"\n"
"The bot should say that the snippet has been added.\n"
"\n"
"Next, type @DoNotRepeatBot, press <code>space</code> and type <i>hello</i>.\n"
"The bot should suggest you the snippet you added, tap on it and the bot "
"sends it to the chat! That's it!\n"
"\n"
"If you don't get the snippet, make sure you are typing the title correctly. "
"Else, try after a few seconds, as Telegram might <i>cache</i> the results.\n"
"What we saw now is just a tip of the features, the bot can do!\n"
"\n"
"You can learn more about the bot from the <a href='https://github.com/j-arun-"
"mani/DoNotRepeatBot'>repository</a>.\n"
"There is also /help to give you overview of available commands and methods.\n"
"Finally, feel free to tell your thoughts and feedback in @DoNotRepeat üòâ!"
