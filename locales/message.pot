"@DoNotRepeatBot is a bot to share messages at multiple places when needed "
"without the need to create the message again.\n"
"\n"
"Take it like this. You have a message you happen to use at multiple chats so "
"what you do is, save the message to <i>Saved Messages</i> and forward it "
"everytime you need it.\n"
"@DoNotRepeatBot does the same, but with extra features and more "
"streamlined!\n"
"\n"
"<b>Getting Started</b>\n"
"Let's start with a simple example. Start the bot in private message. Type "
"and send <code>/add hello</code>.\n"
"Now the bot will ask you for the message to store. Simply send a textual "
"message. It can be anything of your creativity!\n"
"\n"
"The bot should say that the snippet has been added.\n"
"\n"
"Next, type @DoNotRepeatBot, press <code>space</code> and type <i>hello</i>.\n"
"The bot should suggest you the snippet you added, tap on it and the bot "
"sends it to the chat! That's it!\n"
"\n"
"If you don't get the snippet, make sure you are typing the title correctly. "
"Else, try after a few seconds, as Telegram might <i>cache</i> the results.\n"
"What we saw now is just a tip of the features, the bot can do!\n"
"\n"
"You can learn more about the bot by using the <a href='https://github.com/j-"
"arun-mani/DoNotRepeatBot'>documentation</a>.\n"
"There is also /help to give you overview of available commands and methods.\n"
"Finally, feel free to tell your thoughts and feedback in @DoNotRepeat üòâ!"

"<b>Syntax</b>\n"
"‚Ä¢ <code>[ARG]</code> - <code>ARG</code> is optional and need not be "
"provided.\n"
"‚Ä¢ <code>&lt;ARG&gt;</code> - <code>ARG</code> is essential and must be "
"provided.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Commands</b>\n"
"‚Ä¢ /add [<code>title</code>]\n"
"This command creates a new snippet with title provided.\n"
"If title is not provided, then the first few characters of the snippet body "
"is used a title. If used as it is, I will prompt you for snippet. If the "
"command is a reply to a message, then that message is used.\n"
"A message to be made snippet can be normal message or file (audio, photo, "
"video etc.) or a sticker. Title is mandatory if the message doesn't have any "
"textual content.\n"
"\n"
"‚Ä¢ /clear\n"
"Clear all the snippets of the chat.\n"
"Be careful before using it!\n"
"\n"
"‚Ä¢ /del <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>\n"

"Present a beginner friendly tutorial.\n"
"\n"
"‚Ä¢ /help\n"
"The very same help message.\n"
"\n"
"‚Ä¢ /import\n"
"Start the import process.\n"
"Using <i>import</i>, you can add multiple snippets without invidual /add.\n"
"First send /import and send (or forward) messages to added. The title is "
"automatically obtained from first few characters of the textual content. "
"Use /done to finish the import.\n"
"\n"
"‚Ä¢ /lang [<code>lang</code>]\n"
"Change my language to <code>lang</code>.\n"
"Send the command without any language to view available languages.\n"
"\n"
"‚Ä¢ /list\n"
"List the snippets associated with the chat.\n"
"Tap the title to view the snippet.\n"
"\n"
"‚Ä¢ /start\n"
"Start the adventure.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Inline Mode</b>\n"
"Type @DoNotRepeatBot in a chat and press space.\n"
"I will show you available snippets which you can filter by typing title or "
"text of the snippet.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Text</b>\n"
"Use #hashtag notation to get snippets via title.\n"
"For example, #hello will send snippet named <code>title</code>\n"
"\n"
"<b>Notes</b>\n"
"1. Addition, deletion and other manipulation tasks require the user to be an "
"admin in groups.\n"
"2. Language is automatically set to the language the user uses. For groups "
"it is always set to English unless changed by an admin.\n"
"\n"
"You can learn more about the bot by using the <a href='https://github.com/j-"
"arun-mani/DoNotRepeatBot'>documentation</a>.\n"
"There is also /help to give you overview of available commands and methods.\n"
"Finally, feel free to tell your thoughts and feedback in @DoNotRepeat üòâ!"
